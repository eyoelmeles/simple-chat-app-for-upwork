# Simple Chat APP to for upwork!

I made a simple json server to show data fetching with **RTKQuery**

the whole thing took me around 2 hours to complete,

I know, There are a lot of things to do, to even consider it half way done. but I don't want my proposal to be very late

## Gettting Started

### Backend

install the json-server
`npx json-server --watch ./src/db.json --port 3004`

### Frontend

`npm run start` to run the front end.

### Features

[x] - list groups
[x] - list messages from a specific group
[x] - create a message in a specific group (because of json server, don't work. but if it was a real database it would have. you can check the network tab)
[ ] create a group
[ ] create users
[ ] add authentication
[ ] create more features
